# Project Title

This is my first coding project as part of the IronHack bootcamp. It's a game called **Family Memories** and it's just like a regular *memory game* but using pictures of loved children from my family.

## Game rules

1. Cards will be mixed up
2. All cards face down
3. Player turn over any two cards
   * If the two cards match we keep them
   * If they don't match, we turn them back over
4. Remember what was on each card and where it was
5. Watch and remember during the other player's turn
6. The game is over when all the cards have been matched
7. The player with the most matches wins

## Prerequisites

No real prereqs, just use your **browser**, game is using startdard *HTML, CSS and JavaScript*.

## Installing

You can run it offline by downloading the project files or you can run my online instance from ------

If you want to customize the game with your own family pictures, just throw the image files inside **img** folder and edit the constant array family from *script.js* with the family members names which must match the pictures filenames.

   Example:
    const family = ['Romeo', 'Juliet', 'John', 'Mary'];
   **img* folder must have correspondent files *Romeo.jpg, Juliet.jpg, John.jpg, Mary.jpg* inside it.
